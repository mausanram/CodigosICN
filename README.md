This repository contains scripts and processes for analyzing all data from a Skipper-type charge-coupled device (CCD) particle sensor. 
Here you will find some examples of data (images in FITS format) collected during the implementation of this project. 
The main programming language is Python, but there are also scripts in C++ available, specifically ROOT and Geant4 macros.
